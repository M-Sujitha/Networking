A port is a virtual communication endpoint used to identify specific processes or services on a device.
Ports allow multiple applications to send and receive data simultaneously over a single network connection.
Each port has a unique number (0–65535).

TYPES OF PORTS:

1. Well-Known Ports (0–1023):
Used by standard services like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH.


2. Registered Ports (1024–49151):
Used by user applications like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.


3. Dynamic / Private Ports (49152–65535):
Temporarily used by applications for internal communication.
