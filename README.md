TCP/IP Protocol

The TCP/IP protocol (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) is a fundamental communication model that enables data transfer between a source and a destination over a network. It consists of four layers:

1. Application Layer

This is the topmost layer. It provides services for end-user applications and defines protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, and POP3.
Examples of real-world applications using this layer include web browsers, WhatsApp, and email clients.

2. Transport Layer

This layer ensures reliable or fast delivery of data between systems. It breaks data into segments and uses either TCP or UDP based on the need for reliability or speed.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
Provides reliable, connection-oriented, and orderly data transfer. Lost packets are retransmitted. Used in websites, emails, and messages.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol):
Provides fast, connectionless transmission without guaranteeing delivery. Used in real-time applications like video calls, live streaming, and online games.

3. Internet Layer

This layer handles data as packets. It assigns IP addresses, adds header information, and determines the best route for data to reach its destination.
Protocols in this layer include IP, ICMP, ARP, and IGMP.


4. Network Access Layer

Also called the Link Layer, it deals with the physical transmission of data through the network.
It uses communication media such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or fiber optic cables to send bits over the network.
